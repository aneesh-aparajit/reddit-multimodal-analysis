# Reddit Multimodal Analysis

This project aims to try to find correlation and similarities between two different sub-reddits based on the content they post. This project takes use of the **multimodal** data such as images, audio, video, etc.

## Dataset
- For this, I use the ["Memotion 7k Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/williamscott701/memotion-dataset-7k).
